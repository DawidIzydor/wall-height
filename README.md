# Wall Height (Enhanced)

Thank you to Cole Schultz (cole#9640) for the original implementation. I  have now taken over the Module.

*If you enjoy this module, please upvote or comment on the [Gitlab Issue](https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/1829) for it to be added to core so that this feature can get the support it deserves.*

Adds the ability to set wall height for walls so that tokens can look over them (or under them).  3.5 adds the ability to MOVE over and under walls as well.

3.5 also adds the ability to enable this feature on a scene by scene basis, as many maps may find it unnecessary:

The top and bottom heights of the walls are configurable in the wall configuration dialog.

## Project Status

Wall Height was originally released as a proof of concept to show that just a feature was possible by (cole#9640). I am now maintaining and adding to this modules and accepting feature requests.

In addition to adding movement and the scene by scene enablement, I have update the code to use the latest vision refresh methods.

## Compatibility

This module is likely incompatible with modules which modify token vision.
